A tutorial for the [Teach Me QISKit Award](https://qx-awards.mybluemix.net/teachMeQiskitAward) contest of IBM.
It is devoted to the E91 quantum key distribution protocol developed by Artur Ekert.

GitHub fails to display correctly some LaTeX in Jupyter Notebooks. 
The correctly displayed notebook can be seen [here](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/kardashin/QKDprotocols/blob/master/E91_quantum_key_distribution_protocol/e91_quantum_key_distribution_protocol.ipynb)

The GitHub-friendly (more or less) version *e91_github-friendly.ipynb* is also availabe.

A program that simulates the E91 quantum key distribution protocol.
QISKit is requiered for executing.

There is also a [tutorial](https://github.com/kardashin/E91_protocol/blob/master/E91_tutorial/E91_tutorial.ipynb) on the E91 protocol.
This tutorial is created for the [Teach Me QISKit Award](https://qx-awards.mybluemix.net/) contest; an IBM-maintained version is located [here](https://github.com/qiskit-community/qiskit-community-tutorials/blob/6de54e7033edc4233142caecda257ed72a6735f5/awards/teach_me_qiskit_2018/e91_qkd/e91_quantum_key_distribution_protocol.ipynb).

The program was written fot the very first versions of Qiskit and now, probably, is not working.
